260	@SouthwestAir thank you. Great customer service so far. Accidents happen I understand. Hopefully everything works out.
261	@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
262	@SouthwestAir opened online applications for Fall 2015 intern positions throughout the company.  Apply via https://t.co/GmL7ot3IMH
263	@SouthwestAir honesty should always be the policy
264	@SouthwestAir thanks for the quick response. Should I call daily it wait the 5 days.
265	@SouthwestAir I knew I was correct! http://t.co/9eueYxAwcv

270	@SouthwestAir prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don't even know why it's behind schedule.
271	@SouthwestAir seeing your workers time in and time out going above and beyond is why I love flying with you guys. Thank you!
272	@SouthwestAir u were bae until u lost both of my bags and had no clue where they were or what happened to them for 36 hours :/
273	@SouthwestAir prove it
274	@SouthwestAir Travel agent Darrel here at Love Field hosting a paper airplane contest to entertain all the children was so awesome to see!
275	@SouthwestAir Big kudos to your staff today at Dallas Love Field for lifting everyone's spirits today with all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations
276	@SouthwestAir it's not fun having a delay from Nashville to Las Vegas, but the crew at the gate C9 desk has been AWESOME! #patience #luvswa
277	@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
278	Never got to the strip that fast before. Stoked for special @Imaginedragons show tonight! Thx again @SouthwestAir! http://t.co/ToPqmVqnJp
279	@SouthwestAir The problem is apologies don't help. Results matter and it's proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that.
280	@SouthwestAir no fare giving out clues.  In route now.
281	@SouthwestAir telling my Fam in Vegas now. :)
282	@SouthwestAir How many tickets are left?
283	@SouthwestAir thank you!
284	@SouthwestAir- is new #MKT strategy to be average like all the rest? #whathappend? RR Points Devalued- AGAIN -http://t.co/mDbDYomrs7
285	@SouthwestAir do these scavenger hunt  locations have anything in common because I'm playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL.
286	@SouthwestAir Why do you have to be 18 😭
287	@SouthwestAir ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury.
288	@SouthwestAir What can we do to bring you back to Jackson, MS?! We miss you terribly around here. These other airlines are horrible!!
289	@SouthwestAir Any idea why TSA Pre-Check isn't showing for my next flight tomorrow? The number is in my profile...
290	@SouthwestAir 3 hours and 80 degree difference. Yes please!!  MHT TO MCO @sadie4406 http://t.co/MRAW3qDw4D
291	@SouthwestAir sent. looking for that functionality in your app, though. should be a one click action.
292	@SouthwestAir still there? I was posted up in Downtown waiting for y'all. On my way!
293	@SouthwestAir like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio?
294	@SouthwestAir are 5 people there?
295	@SouthwestAir looks like Bellagio to me! Good luck people! See you at the show at Vinyl
296	“@SouthwestAir: Congrats to these fans who are seeing #DestinationDragons in L.A.! SLC, you're next! http://t.co/YcCITaeP3S” Thanks again SW
297	@SouthwestAir Can a pair of tickets waiting for me after my sports practice? I live here and definitely know where that is! @Imaginedragons
298	@SouthwestAir Love Southwest. You guys have been good to me! http://t.co/X4tDY84dBH
299	@SouthwestAir how about #destinationdragon tix for tonite for the inconvenience since I am not there to play scavenger hunt?
300	@SouthwestAir Dang, if only practice was an hour Late Flightr today...
301	"@SouthwestAir that was supposed to say ""boo"" not book. booo."
302	@SouthwestAir #Vegas I was there 5 days ago. Miss the  Warm Weather
303	@SouthwestAir Your crew on 3138 is doing a great job of keeping everyone informed during the delays #givethemraises
304	@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
305	@SouthwestAir really easy for locals to get down to the strip. book.
306	@SouthwestAir: grrrrrr I need a flight there first! Maybe for my bday next month...
307	@SouthwestAir LUV! your new Luv Television Commercials. Traveled on your airline last year return trip from NYC...#feltthelove
308	@SouthwestAir is it possible to add travel arranged by my employer to my upcoming travel? I can retrieve a reservation, but that's it.
309	@SouthwestAir  I sent a email to customer relations and I will be calling tomorrow.
310	@SouthwestAir how do get priority seating after you already paid for the flight
311	"@SouthwestAir 10+ people pre boarded
Only 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding"
312	@SouthwestAir Is it possible to add companion to only the 2nd leg of a trip?
313	@SouthwestAir best airline 👌
314	@southwestair #netneutrality Nice to see you prioritize Internet traffic to your own streaming service over other web sites!
315	@SouthwestAir  Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer!
316	@SouthwestAir  Northern California coast http://t.co/nm4VNNF8Kb
317	@SouthwestAir hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
318	@southwestair watching planes do their thing https://t.co/iItoJhUIKH
319	@SouthwestAir Thanks for getting us to paradise safely! http://t.co/KDzQcZlpyR
320	@SouthwestAir Feeling very frustrated that I bought WIFI onboard and can't load an email.
321	@SouthwestAir continues to prove to be the best airlines 💪
322	@SouthwestAir Just go ahead and start the scavenger hunt after 5 pm today when work is over ;) #DestinationDragons
323	@SouthwestAir why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149
324	@SouthwestAir thanks!!
325	@SouthwestAir Awesome staff at the  check in desk! They had a paper airplane race for a SW gift card to keep ppl entertained during delays
326	@SouthwestAir but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!?
327	@SouthwestAir is this a sick joke? #toyingwithouremotions
328	@SouthwestAir , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm?????
329	@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
330	@SouthwestAir just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. Class act. I appreciate that!
331	@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel
332	@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
333	@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
334	@SouthwestAir done. Sorry, I thought I was already.
335	@SouthwestAir I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them?
336	@SouthwestAir  Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock!
337	@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice.
338	"@SouthwestAir weren't too ""sincere"" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home.."
339	@SouthwestAir Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock!
340	@SouthwestAir  Your Terry is our hero.  Got my husband back thru security to retrieve his cellphone in Austin. Terry (#85832) You Rock!
341	@SouthwestAir Thanks, you guys are the best
342	@SouthwestAir I'll stick with flying for free any where that Southwest goes; my son works for this wonderful company and Moms fly free.
343	@SouthwestAir if only you could control the weather in Las Vegas 😉
344	@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
345	@SouthwestAir could you please tell me if there is a way to add a RR# to a flight that already took place?
346	@SouthwestAir hooking us up and getting us to Tampa after our flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning #grateful #businesstrip
347	@SouthwestAir love the passbook update. Used it the day after it was released. Finally!! Thank you!
348	@SouthwestAir my ticket was booked 1/27 to CUN. Does the arrival time reflect that CUN is now on EST time?
349	@SouthwestAir @HDsportsguy yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow.
350	@SouthwestAir A+ to the Safety Dos and Don'ts Announcer. Flight 651 from Midway (MDW) to Pittsburgh (PIT)!
351	@SouthwestAir this is not a fair set up. I payed for a full seat. I should get access to a full seat. http://t.co/SbA0ARicyq
352	@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?
353	@SouthwestAir another great trip! LAX 823 - LAS 3075-  BNA. Thanks so much!!!
354	@SouthwestAir  your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha
355	@SouthwestAir yeah they're somewhere. Hopefully getting them back today. Just frustrated tweeting.
356	@SouthwestAir Completely understand Act of God weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightlation, but 4 days without reimbursement of any kind is #unacceptable
357	@SouthwestAir why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition
358	@SouthwestAir delayed twice now Cancelled Flighted...sent complaint email, yet no response.  Need an explanation pls. #notsatisfied #smh #unhappy
359	@SouthwestAir Got help from a nice lady on the phone in Georgia.  Thank you!
360	@SouthwestAir When will the flight resume? I don's see it in the open schedule. :/
361	@SouthwestAir understand the weather, these kids need to get home! Nice kids doing volunteer work from a RI high school, please help
362	@SouthwestAir Thanks for the quick reply!  I travel a lot...but not that much, lol.
363	@SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time.
364	@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
365	@SouthwestAir I regret not flying you this morning @VirginAmerica doesn't support business travelers. #neverflyvirginforbusiness
366	@SouthwestAir Thanks. I did go through these motions shortly after my flight yesterday. I wonder how quickly flight attendants are notified.
367	@SouthwestAir  how many others didn't know you are stopping non stop flights to ATL and from to Hartford Ct as of April ?
368	"@SouthwestAir Thanks, Lindsey. Any idea when I'll get there?! Stuck in Denver and told to ""listen to the intercom better""."
369	@SouthwestAir nice touch on the passbook integration!
370	@SouthwestAir easy fix, let the business select actually board 1st, then board the pre-boards...
371	@SouthwestAir a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it's being abused @ every airport...
372	@SouthwestAir it's not disappointment, it's a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it's becoming a problem that's pushing
373	@SouthwestAir need assistance getting an extension on a flight that has expired.
374	@SouthwestAir Awesome. Thanks! You guys rock!
375	@SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight?
376	@SouthwestAir when can we expect customer service in Dallas to be available
377	@SouthwestAir it eventually arrived. just seemed really slow. :)
378	@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed.
379	@SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.
380	@SouthwestAir Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0
381	@SouthwestAir  thanks for adding passbook ability! Hopefully we can do group passbook tickets in the future somehow.
382	@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.
383	@SouthwestAir they arrived Late Flight but pilots got us to DIA on time. #impressive #outstanding #greatservice #allgood
384	@SouthwestAir I would appreciate that.  Thank you.
385	@SouthwestAir I never got an email confirmation for my ticket, but the credit card was charged.  Phone wait time is crazy. Is there a chat?
386	@SouthwestAir res chg online/app no work, still on hold, faster for hubby to DRIVE to airport to make change @ counter #fail
387	@SouthwestAir Can my wife's RR points be transferred to my RR account?
388	@SouthwestAir my friends from Boston stuck in Denver. Her name Jane. @RnCahill  Please contact her.
389	@SouthwestAir I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours.
390	@SouthwestAir Wasn't able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2
391	@SouthwestAir Glad to know I'll be flying the luv airline tomorrow ;)
392	@SouthwestAir yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage.
393	@SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!!
394	@SouthwestAir Just got companion pass and trying to add companion flgt but get purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS. Help!
395	@SouthwestAir I did. Still haven't heard a thing.
396	@SouthwestAir thank you for great customer service. Trying to make it to San Antonio and your staff and alerts have been helpful. Boo ice!
397	@SouthwestAir open seating is like an open marriage, there's so much love for strangers!
398	@SouthwestAir I hope this isn't a real life scene out of the movie 'Flight' .....
399	@SouthwestAir : thanks.are flights operating now or Cancelled Flightled?

434	@SouthwestAir @nelsjeff, 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn't sell out.
435	@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.

452	@SouthwestAir got an email confirmation of wifi purchase on a recent flight. Trouble is, I've never flown with you. Ever. #concerned #scam?
453	@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC

462	@SouthwestAir show me some love and a companion flight~please and thank you!
463	@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail
464	@SouthwestAir loved it!
465	@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
466	@SouthwestAir I am in, let's do this!
467	@SouthwestAir You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.)
468	@SouthwestAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
469	"@southwestair,  kudos to your rep ""Patricia"" at gate B11 this Sunday morning at #Chicago #Midway #MDW,… http://t.co/MmCWkqp2gy"
470	@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled. new flight 7 hours Late Flightr. will sleep in airport tonight. and cant even give me an A Boarding Group seat. thx
471	@SouthwestAir Just reading your boarding policy, we're a group of 8 travellers with kids ranging from 3-10, is it possible to sit together?
472	@SouthwestAir you're right, I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night.
473	@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
474	@SouthwestAir broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it's not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now.
475	@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys 💔😪
476	@SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass.
477	@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
478	.@SouthwestAir Thx for the follow up. Just sent DM
479	@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
480	@SouthwestAir TY for your consideration!
481	@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
482	@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
483	"@SouthwestAir It was never really ""lost"" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren't sure what flight but I have it - TY!"
484	@SouthwestAir crew of WN3946 SAN-SFO was brilliant! Rita was hilarious. I know I've been down on you before, but this was a great flight
485	@SouthwestAir is not being responding to the @SpecialOlympics athletes.  #notcool #Southwest
486	@SouthwestAir   A whole family, with a special Olympic athlete here, and you can't even call them? 617-653-3040
487	@SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time.
488	@SouthwestAir thanks! Very excited to see it :D
489	.@SouthwestAir glad you appreciate it, it’ll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service
490	@SouthwestAir waited 34 mins for baggage MDW&gt;MEM and the in-flight service was suspended so no drink 😕
491	@southwestair yeah, 7am flight tomorrow, going to add 60-90 min extra because of the roads / snow
492	@SouthwestAir Thanks for helping my mom after @allegiantair wouldn't let her get on her plane in Orlando! You're the best! #customerservice
493	@SouthwestAir me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal?
494	@SouthwestAir I know that not everybody on flight can be 1st time flying. But in case it is people in front deplane 1st not from the back?!?
495	@SouthwestAir may I have my Companion pass please.
496	@SouthwestAir kudos to the crew of flight 1050 to GRR for making a very special memory for a sweet young passenger, and her Momma. Well done
497	"@SouthwestAir thank you : 8UXZJ2
Paid for early bird and sat in back"
498	@SouthwestAir All good... beers and #oscars2015 ar #DIA
499	@SouthwestAir yes, please #companionpass
500	@SouthwestAir @fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night.
501	@SouthwestAir luv my companion pass!
502	@southwestair Winter Weather for Denver extended for tomorrow by chance? Even to Late Flightr in the day would be super helpful.
503	@SouthwestAir it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago
504	@SouthwestAir I need to Cancelled Flight one leg of a flight, but can't seem to do this online. Been on hold on the phone for 10 minutes. Any help?
505	@SouthwestAir A-list preferred. DEN-DAL flight Cancelled Flightled 30 min prior to boarding. Best option was Tue afternoon. Seriously?!? Epic fail.
506	@SouthwestAir Free TV watching Daytona 500! #Boss http://t.co/SbGBN7oUXy
507	@SouthwestAir I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country.
508	@SouthwestAir thank you!!
509	@SouthwestAir been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me.
510	@SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.
511	@SouthwestAir how do I get a companion pass
512	@SouthwestAir especially if it's your mom! #IChangedYourDiaper
513	@SouthwestAir @MegElizabeth631 how you like the #redcarpet treatment
514	@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?
515	@SouthwestAir I'm flying out of CUN tomorrow To DEN - can I change my flight due to the travel advisory??
516	@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
517	@SouthwestAir Don't apologize. Do something about it. Words mean nothing. Actions work. EOM.
518	@SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy 😣
519	@SouthwestAir how long does it take for my Rapid Rewards points to be credited to my account?
520	@SouthwestAir why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
521	@SouthwestAir we're pulling off the runway now! Making new friends with seat mates. Thanks for the response CB.
522	@SouthwestAir but to make us tru to find space in other flights.  This customer service is as bad as @SpiritAirlines.
523	@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
524	@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan.
525	@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
526	@SouthwestAir it's ok! Southwest is still the best airline around! Just hate when baggage room runs out.. My now checked bag has headphones!
527	@SouthwestAir please start flying to Huntsville so I never have to fly American Airlines again
528	@SouthwestAir Flight 3267 (N659SW) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @MitchellAirport http://t.co/LJ2YdKoR8q

587	@SouthwestAir Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from @flyLAXairport &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous
588	@SouthwestAir should get their shit together before they owe my $2,000 for my bag.
589	@SouthwestAir I requested my boarding pass to be texted to me but I still haven't received it.
590	@SouthwestAir I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time.
591	@SouthwestAir I'm gonna ignore the fasten seatbelt sign and I want to see if ur man enough to do anything about it!!!

611	@SouthwestAir your wifi is angering me with its slowness
612	@SouthwestAir thank you!
613	@SouthwestAir we've been at the gate a long time. We're gonna miss our connection at MDW. Ack! http://t.co/qRXvZFrD1Z
614	@SouthwestAir I tweeted several times last week about flight info during storm, always a timely tweet back.  Thx! 😄
615	@SouthwestAir Sort of, but I'm arriving a day Late Flight and have to incur overnight costs in a connecting city. Not cool at all...
616	@SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white?
617	@SouthwestAir just sent it
618	@SouthwestAir if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue
619	@SouthwestAir your hold music sounds like it's from Super Mario Bros for gameboy color
620	@SouthwestAir props to your LAS employees working C11 gate. Because of them I am not opposed to flying through or to LAS in the future! 👏👏👏
621	@SouthwestAir baggage delivery at BWI very delayed and unnecessarily chaotic. Disappointing after a long trip! From a frequent traveler
622	@SouthwestAir most other carriers were flying out way past SW Cancelled Flightlation. @AlaskaAir and @JetBlue got their passengers out much Late Flightr!!!!!
623	@SouthwestAir extremely frustrating travel experience in Denver! Instead of landing in SEA on Saturday, now it's Monday afternoon!
624	@SouthwestAir I will be calling someone on Monday in customer relations. Very disappointed in how I was treated by customer service!
625	"@SouthwestAir your ""complimentary"" hotel vouchers are BS! $79 a night for the crappiest hotel ever! I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy!"
626	@SouthwestAir worst air line ever, you have no compassion of the handicapped
627	@SouthwestAir when are the two free flights promo coming back?! Looking into the premiere card but might hold off or go with another option!

660	@SouthwestAir could I get a phone call from a customer service rep to get the issue resolved?
661	@SouthwestAir think you have great people working for you.
662	@SouthwestAir Way to go flying out of Denver today! Must be the only airline not Cancelled Flighting/delaying flights! #FlySWA #denverairport
663	@SouthwestAir here's a first..both pilot and first officer in galley during flight...
664	@SouthwestAir -- any updates on flights getting Cancelled Flighted into DAL? I have a connecting flight there and hope it doesn't delay due to weather
665	@SouthwestAir Flight 52 got Cancelled Flightled 6 hrs before takeoff. No Customer Service. Been on hold for 30 minutes.
666	@SouthwestAir my flight continues through to Vegas after my stop. Don't be upset if a stowaway.

673	@SouthwestAir As a frequent traveler, I've never been treated so coldly &amp; had an airline offer nothing when my flight was Cancelled Flightled. #nolove
674	@SouthwestAir - neveryamind I paid $450 for a flight. 250 for a new bag is easy for business class customers, right? http://t.co/vn3JJIa53O
675	@SouthwestAir - our baggage motto: we don't cover that. Small tear, ripped seam, snow soaked, busted zippers - SORRY http://t.co/LHwFBKFynI
676	@SouthwestAir Totally ruined my birthday weekend by Cancelled Flighting my flights for no reason and offer no points, drink, transport. #nolove #cali
677	@SouthwestAir What's happened to your customer service? 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in 2 days &amp; an uninformed and unapologetic staff. #nolove #cali
678	@SouthwestAir check the head of the plane, there has been dynamite placed onto it
679	@SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
680	@SouthwestAir For the past 2 yrs I earned A-list status thru a promo-fly 3 rnd trips in 2-3 months. How can I get that option again? #loyal
681	@SouthwestAir we didn't nothing was ruined just wet. Just frustrating when after traveling for 12 hours you can't change into clean clothes
682	@SouthwestAir yeah it happens. The PHX airport has extra long waits all spring long. Something locals know but tourist don't just FYI
683	@SouthwestAir I tried for 5hrs to contact SW! Twitter, fb, phone, email w/ no reply. 24hrs Late Flightr u respond, what could you do at this point?
684	@SouthwestAir Arkansas Gov. plans to sign Governor SB-202 that legalizes discrimination of LGBT.Can you lend your voice to a state boycott?
685	@SouthwestAir if I am a rapid awards member, does my points apply after I have taken my round trip?
